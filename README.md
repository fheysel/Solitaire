# Solitaire
C++ AutoStart heuristic for the classic Forty Thieves Solitaire game and accompanying algorithm analysis report.
Greedy heuristic for AutoStart game function. The AutoStart function is customary in most virtual solitaire games and is used to move as many top cards from their unsorted piles to a sorted pile as possible before needing to flip a card. Justification of heuristic due to NP-Completness of problem and O(n) runtime achieved an A+ for creative thinking.
